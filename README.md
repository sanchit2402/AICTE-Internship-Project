# Human Pose Estimation

## Overview
This project focuses on **Human Pose Estimation**, a computer vision technique that predicts human body keypoints and their connections from images or video frames. By leveraging deep learning models, this system can detect and track the positions of joints such as shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles, enabling a wide range of applications like fitness tracking, motion analysis, augmented reality, and more.

## Features
- **Real-Time Pose Estimation:** Detects and tracks human poses in real-time.
- **Keypoint Detection:** Identifies key body parts and their spatial coordinates.
- **Visualization:** Displays the detected poses overlaid on the input image or video.
- **Customizable Models:** Supports pre-trained models and custom configurations for accuracy and speed trade-offs.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works with images and live video feeds from various sources.
